# OXXYMORE INTERACTIVE

🎮 Independent Game Studio & Interactive Systems Lab

OXXYMORE INTERACTIVE is a French independent studio dedicated to the design of original game experiences and interactive systems, with a strong focus on strategy, cognition and meaningful gameplay.

We explore the intersection of:

- strategic thinking and game design,
- competitive and systemic mechanics,
- cognition, learning dynamics and experimentation,
- original narrative and conceptual universes.

## What we build

- Original intellectual properties, inspired by board games and designed for digital-first environments  
- Experimental game mechanics combining strategy, logic and depth  
- Cognitive and learning-oriented interactive experiences, without prescriptive intent  
- Internal tools, prototypes and research-oriented projects

One of our ongoing universes in development is **OBAN**.

## Philosophy

We believe games can be:

- demanding without being exclusionary,  
- competitive without being shallow,  
- intellectually stimulating without being dogmatic.

Our approach values:

- clarity over noise,  
- depth over gimmicks,  
- long-term vision over short-term hype.

## Organization & repositories

This GitHub organization hosts:

- internal tools and experiments,  
- game prototypes and technical foundations,  
- shared components used across our projects,  
- documentation and governance-related repositories when relevant.

Some repositories are intentionally kept private during active development or experimentation phases.
