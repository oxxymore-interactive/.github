OXXYMORE INTERACTIVE is a French independent studio dedicated to the creation of original, strategic and educational game experiences.

We design games and interactive systems at the intersection of:

- strategy and cognition  
- competitive gameplay  
- learning and decision-making  
- strong narrative universes

## 🎯 What we build

## 🧠 Philosophy

We believe games can be:

- demanding without being exclusionary,  
- competitive without being shallow,  
- educational without being boring.

We value:

- clarity over noise,  
- depth over gimmicks,  
- long-term vision over short-term hype.
